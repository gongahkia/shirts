## Project Overview  
Shirts is a full-stack web application featuring a sophisticated backend server implementing a fully functional agentic workflow for handling legal business processes. Using Gemini 2 free API integrated with cutting-edge Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, it manages end-to-end legal workflows from initial plaintiff intake, legal reasoning, to multi-stage document generation and output formatting. The project aims to learn and incorporate best practices for RAG and agentic pipelines, providing transparency, extensibility, and legal domain-specific intelligence. The frontend interfaces with the backend through API calls, offering a distinct, user-friendly UI tailored to legal professionals.

## Key Features  
- Backend server implementing multi-agent workflows coordinating distinct legal process stages.  
- Integration with Gemini 2 free API for powerful contextual natural language generation and reasoning.  
- RAG pipeline to combine external retrieval of legal documents, precedents, and data with model reasoning.  
- Legal workflow stages: plaintiff intake, legal argument generation, document drafting, review, and output formatting.  
- Modular pipeline design enabling injection of new agents or replacement of components without disrupting overall flow.  
- Frontend SPA with unique UI/UX focused on legal professionals for managing ongoing cases and workflows.  
- Real-time status monitoring of agentic pipeline steps with logs and error handling.  

## Technical Specifications  

### Backend  
- Built with Node.js or Python (FastAPI/Flask) supporting asynchronous workflows.  
- Agentic pipeline modeled as a modular orchestration of agents (e.g., intake agent, RAG retriever, document synthesis agent).  
- Gemini 2 free API integration with secure key management and rate limiting.  
- RAG system combining vector-based semantic search over legal corpora with LLM generation.  
- Document generation pipeline supporting multi-format outputs (PDF, DOCX, HTML).  
- REST or GraphQL API exposing workflow control, status, and results.  

### Frontend  
- React 18+ with TypeScript.  
- Custom visually distinct UI/dark mode, tailored to legal domain aesthetics.  
- Workflow dashboard showing progress and status of legal cases through pipeline stages.  
- Interfaces for inputting case data, reviewing generated documents, and managing workflows.  
- Notifications and error reporting for smooth user experience.  

## Deliverables  
- Fully implemented backend with modular agentic workflow and RAG system.  
- Frontend SPA frontend for user interaction and workflow management.  
- Integrated Gemini 2 API calls with smart prompting strategies.  
- Documentation of RAG and agentic pipeline design and usage.  
- Tests covering backend agents, API, and frontend interactions.  
- Deployment scripts and environment config for cloud hosting.

## Learning and Exploration Focus  
- Provide clear comments and documentation explaining how RAG and agentic pipelines work within the code.  
- Include illustrative examples and mock data for training and testing workflow stages.  
- Allow flexibility for future enhancements based on legal domain intricacies.

## Development Environment  
- Node.js 20+ or Python 3.10+ backend  
- React 18+, TypeScript frontend  
- Docker containerization for development and production parity  
- Testing with Jest, React Testing Library, Pytest or equivalent

## Notes for Claude Code  
- Generate complete end-to-end pipeline backend and frontend codebases, including folder structure, build & test config.  
- Articulate detailed modular design of agents and augmenters in backend.  
- Implement RAG with vector search and document retrieval integrated with Gemini 2 calls.  
- Design frontend with clean UX showing workflow states and outputs dynamically.  
- Add extensive inline documentation and clear README explanations about legal workflows, RAG, and agentic process.
